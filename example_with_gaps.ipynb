    "A classic example, known as the 1D advection equation.\n",
    "Advection is the transport of some chemical (or any quantity really) by a fluid with a given velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to determine the concentration distribution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the following variables:\n",
    "- $t:$ time.\n",
    "- $x:$ this represents a position in space, e.g. in a column or pipe.\n",
    "In theory, we could consider more coordinates, but this adds complexity.\n",
    "- $c:$ this is the concentration of the chemical being 'carried' by the fluid.\n",
    "The concentration varies with space, $x$, and over time, $t$.\n",
    "In general, this could be any quantity, e.g. mass.\n",
    "- $\\nu:$ the velocity of the fluid.\n",
    "Can vary with time, $t$, and space, $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a pipe with a fixed length, $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the problem we make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The velocity of the fluid is constant (i.e. it doesn't change over time, $t$, and is the same at all positions, $x$).\n",
    "- Diffusion of the chemical in the fluid is negligible.\n",
    "- Concentration is small enough to not affect the motion of the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above we can derive the following hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial c(x, t)}{\\partial t} + \\nu\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}=0\n",
