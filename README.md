# Numerical methods example

This repo contains simple numerical example (1d wave equation - constant velocity) intended for teaching and demonstration purposes.
There are two files:

- One file with gaps that should be filled during a live demonstration.
- A complete (no gaps) counterpart for the demonstrator to consult during the demonstration.
